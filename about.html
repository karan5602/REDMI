          Redmi is a subsidiary company owned by the Chinese electronics company Xiaomi. It was first announced in July
          2013 as a budget smartphone line,[1] and became a separate sub-brand of Xiaomi in 2019 with entry-level and
          mid-range devices, while Xiaomi itself produces upper-range and flagship Xiaomi (formerly Mi) phones. Redmi
          phones use the Xiaomi's MIUI user interface on top of Android. Models are divided into the entry-level Redmi,
          the mid-range Redmi Note, and the high-end Redmi K. In addition, the unrelated Mi A Android One series is also
          positioned in the similar market segment with Redmi devices, despite being part of the upper-range Xiaomi Mi
          lineup. The most significant difference from other Xiaomi smartphones is that they use less-expensive
          components and thus have lower prices while retaining higher specifications. In August 2014, The Wall Street
          Journal reported that in the second quarter of the 2014 fiscal year, Xiaomi had a market share of 4% of
          smartphone shipment rankings in China.[2] Redmi sales were attributed as a contributing factor toward this
          gain in shipment rankings.[2]

          Redmi is set to bring another new smartphone lineup in the budget segment in India very soon. The company has
          teased the new Redmi A1 smartphone which is likely to focus on the entry-level segment.

          Redmi already has the regular Redmi 10a series in the same price range, but it seems the brand will give the
          Redmi A1 a different twist by offering it a stock Android experience.[

          Xiaomi now has 6 smartphone manufacturing plants in India, will also make PCBAs locally.
        </h1>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Xiaomi on Monday announced the opening of three more smartphone manufacturing plants in India. The company, to
          recall, already has two and one that specifically deals in making power banks. The company, on Monday,
          announced that it has also started manufacturing smartphones at its power bank plant in partnership with Hipad
          Technology in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, resulting in a total of six smartphone manufacturing plants in India to
          date.
          The three new smartphone plants, built in partnership with Foxconn, are located across campuses in Sri City,
          Andhra Pradesh and a new campus in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu with a total campus area of 180 acres. "The
          factories with Foxconn now employ more than 10,000 people, of which more than 95 per cent are females.
          Additionally, all of the assembly work is done by women," Xiaomi said in a statement.

          Xiaomi, in addition, also announced its first SMT (Surface Mount Technology) plant dedicated towards local
          manufacturing of PCBA (Printed Circuit Board Assembly) units in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu, in partnership with
          Foxconn. PCBAs are a critical portion of a smartphone and constitute as much as 50 per cent of a smartphone.
          The fact that Xiaomi will be making PCBAs locally in the days to come -- in fact, the company says it has
          already started with the manufacturing -- means a critical portion of all Xiaomi phones will be locally made
          in India. Xiaomi, to recall, locally manufactures -- assembles -- over 95 per cent of its smartphones in India
          and going forward, it seems like, a larger internal portion of its smartphones will be made -- and not just
          assembled -- in India the country.
